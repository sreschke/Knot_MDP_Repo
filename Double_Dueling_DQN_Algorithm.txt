Instantiate Replay Buffer, Environement, Double Dueling DQN
Fill Buffer
Initialize state
Repeat (for each epoch):
	For N actions:
		get epsilon-greedy action
		take action; get reward, next_state, terminal
		add (state, action, reward, next_state, terminal) to replay buffer
		if terminal:
			get new starting state
		else:
			state=next_state
	get batch from replay buffer
	train online_network using batch
	copy online_weights to target weights every 1000 or so epochs
